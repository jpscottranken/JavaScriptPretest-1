/*
 *
 *	2.	Scenario: Write a JavaScript program that generates
 * 		a random number between 1 - 100 and asks the user to
 *		guess the number.  See the following URL for how to
 *		generate a random number:
 *
 *		https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp
 *
 *		Your Requirements:
 *		==================
 *		a)	Create constants for minimum guess (1),
 *			maximum guess (100), and any string text desired.
 *
 *		b)	Create a main() function.  All of your variables
 *			should be declared in main, and all of your code
 *			should be written in main(). At the end of each
 *			game iteration, ask the user if s/he wants to run
 *			the program again and let them do so indefinitely
 *			if/as desired.
 *
 *		c)	Put in code to clear all global and local variables
 *			at the beginning of each program run.
 *
 *		d)	Put in the code that generates a random number
 *			from 1 â€“ 100 (the constants).
 *
 *		e)	Put in the code that lets the user make a guess.
 *
 *		f)	Put in the code to determine the guess status
 *			(too high, too low, or correct guess).
 *
 *		g)	If a (non-) guess is non-numeric, < 1 or > 100,
 *			the program should display "All guesses must be
 *			numbers between 1 - 100.  Please try again."  Do
 *			not increment total guesses.
 *
 *		h)	If a guess (e.g. 67) is higher/lower than the
 *			generated random number, the program should
 *			display "The guess of 67 is too high/low. Please
 *			try again."  Do increment total guesses.
 *
 *		i)	If a guess (e.g. 67) is correct, the user should
 *			be given an associated message like "The guess of
 *			67 in 4 guesses was correct!"  Increment total
 *			guesses.  Do increment total guesses.
 *
 *		j)	The program should continue to solicit user guesses
 *			until the user correctly guesses the random number.
